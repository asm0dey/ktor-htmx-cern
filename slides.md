# How the usual _should_ enterprise work?

- Teams (2-pizza or so)
- Battle-tested tools
- Sensible timeframe
- Realistic goals
- Enough resources
- Validated hypotheses

---

# What _should_ a usual developer be

- Loves battle-tested technologies
- Works fast
- Estimates perfectly
- Understands business goals

---

# What reality is?

- Time frames are unreasonable
- There are never enough resources
- Complex technologies usually are complicated
- And developers get bored of them

---

# How does the nightmare look?

<v-clicks>

- Hey, we need to write this project
- ASAP
- We do not know what are the needs
- You should do it alone

</v-clicks>

# But I'm not the one who will solve

Software craftsmanship:

- Write Clean, Readable, Maintainable Code
- Continuously learn
- Test your work
- Collaborate and share
- Pursue technical excellence

---

# And every craftsman needs tools

- Ktor
- kotlinx.html
- htmx

---

# Brief introduction to <logos-ktor-icon />

<v-clicks>

- Create asynchronous client and <b>server</b> applications
- Kotlin and Coroutines
- Lightweight and Flexible
- Built and backed by JetBrains

</v-clicks>

# Basic example

```kotlin {1|2|3|4|5|8}
fun main() {
	embeddedServer(Netty, port = 8000) {
		routing {
			get ("/") {
				call.respondText("Hello, world!")
			}
		}
	}.start(wait = true)
}
```

---

# Plugins: Content Negotiation

- Content negotiation

```kotlin {all|2|3|4|5-6}
fun main() {
    embeddedServer(Netty, port = 8080) {
        install(ContentNegotiation) {
          json(Json {
            prettyPrint = true
            isLenient = true
          })
        }
        // ...
    }.start(wait = true)
}

```

---

# Plugin: Content Negotiation

And then

```kotlin {1|2-3|4}
get("/customer/{id}") {
    val id = call.parameters["id"]
    val customer: Customer = customerStorage.find { it.id == id!!.toInt() }!!
    call.respond(customer)
}
```

Ktor uses the `Accept` header to choose the required serializer

---

# Plugin: Webjars

https://www.webjars.org

![](/bulma.png)

---

# Plugin: Webjars

```kotlin {all|2-3}
fun Application.module() {
    install(Webjars) {
        path = "assets"
    }
}
```

<v-click>

And then

```html
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/bootstrap/bootstrap.css" />
</head>
```

</v-click>

---

# Plugin: compression

```kotlin {2|3-5|7-9}
fun Application.http() {
    install(Compression) {
        gzip {
            matchContentType()
            priority = 1.0
        }
        deflate {
            priority = 10.0
            minimumSize(1024) // condition
        }
    }
}
```

---

# Plugin: Call logging

```kotlin {all|2|3-5}
fun Application.monitoring() {
  install(CallLogging) {
    level = Level.INFO
    filter { call -> call.request.path().startsWith("/") }
    callIdMdc("call-id")
  }
}
```

---

# DI

Since I'm spoiled wit Spring, I can't live without DI

```kotlin {all|2-4}
embeddedServer(Netty, port = 8080) {
  di {
    bind<Random> { singleton { SecureRandom() } }
  }
}.start(true)
```

<v-click>

And then

```kotlin {all|1|2-3}
routing {
  controller { MyFirstDIController(instance()) }
  controller("/protected") { MySecondDIController(instance()) }
}
```

</v-click>

# Our example: library

- I have a library in "obscure russian"Â© fb2 format
- I need a web interface for it
- And OPDS interface for it

<v-click>

> The Open Publication Distribution System (OPDS) Catalog format is a syndication format for electronic publications based on Atom and HTTP. OPDS Catalogs enable the aggregation, distribution, discovery, and acquisition of electronic publications.

> OPDS Catalogs use existing or emergent open standards and conventions, with a priority on simplicity.

# BTW I use jOOQ

# <Htmx />

https://htmx.org

> high power tools for HTML

```html {1|2-4|all}
<script src="https://unpkg.com/htmx.org@1.9.10"></script>
<!-- have a button POST a click via AJAX -->
<button hx-post="/clicked" hx-swap="outerHTML">Click Me</button>
```

---

# <Htmx />

When the response comes - it replaces the `button` altogether.

<v-click>

Example response:

```html
<span>OK</span>
```

</v-click>
<v-click>

Result:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/htmx.org@1.9.10"></script>
<span>OK</span>
```

</v-click>

---

# <Htmx/>: Out of band updates

What if I need to update another place on the page?

```html {all|4-6|4}
<div>...</div>
<div id="breadcrumbs" hx-swap-oob="outerHTML:.breadcrumb">My &gt; Page</div>
```

<v-click>

Will replace not only the requested content, but also breadcrumbs with `My > Page`

}
```

# Demo time!

---

# What did we learn?

<v-clicks>

- Ktor and <Htmx /> are the powerful mix
- <Htmx /> is easy to use with `kotlinx.html`
- For a pet project you don't need to know JS/TS
- And even Kotlin/JS
- And _maybe_ for production too

</v-clicks>
